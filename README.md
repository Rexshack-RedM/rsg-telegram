## 🪶 Feature Highlights
- Fully integrated into RSG Telegram  
- Change bird model to any birds we want  
- Notification to sender when the letter is delivered successfully  
- Notification to recipient when the Bird Post is approaching  
- Notification to recipient when he/she is inside a building  
- Notification to recipient when he/she is on a horse and about to pick up the letter  
- Auto resurrect the bird when it dies before the letter is sent successfully  
- Set bird arrival delay (default is 20 seconds)  
- Bird timeout (default is 180 seconds). When timeout reached, the bird will fail to deliver the letter and the recipient can retrieve the letter on the nearby Post Office  
- Optimised loops and fully optimised logics, will only run when the target person is getting a Bird Post approaching  
- Animation for writing and sending the letter  
- Bird Post blip (with blue colour) for the recipient to be able to detect Bird Post position  
- Send letter to ourself for debugging/testing purpose  
- RSG Core Framework Locales support  
- Fully integrated into rsg-hud  
- The bird will follow the target person anywhere until he/she picks up the letter (until the timeout we set reached)  
- Automatic resource cleanup for 'ensure' freaks like myself  
- The bird may stuck at the tall building, that's RDR2 feature. There's no bird flying on the cities, so whenever a Bird Post is coming we'll be notified to stay away from any buildings  
- More improvements to come later

## 🧺 Inventory Item (one-line format)

Add this to `rsg-inventory/items.lua`:
```lua
birdpost = { name = 'birdpost', label = 'Telegram Bird', weight = 500, type = 'item', image = 'birdspost.png', unique = true, useable = true, shouldClose = true, description = 'A trained bird used to deliver telegrams.' },
```

**Note:** The item name (`birdpost`) can be customized via `Config.BirdPostItem` in `config.lua`. Make sure the item name in your inventory matches the config setting.

Usage registration:
```lua
RSGCore.Functions.CreateUseableItem('birdpost', function(src)
    TriggerClientEvent('rsg-telegram:client:openUI', src)
end)
```
